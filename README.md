# Installing Dependencies
To be sure the course files work correctly on your computer, you will need to:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project
3. Run the command **npm install** to install all the project dependencies
4. Finally, you can run **npm run serve** to preview the project as normal in a browser
